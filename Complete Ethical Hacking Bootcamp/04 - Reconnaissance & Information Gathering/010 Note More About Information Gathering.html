<p>Information Gathering Finished! First step down. But you should never limit yourself to only the tools we cover in the course. There are many more out there and some could be even better for you than these. At this link right here you can take a look at top 25 OSIN&nbsp;(Open Source Intelligence) Tools and feel free to test all of them out! Some of them we have covered, some of them you will need to download but that is how you practice.(Just if you go through all of them, make sure you skip "Nmap" as that is something we cover in great details in the next section):</p><p><a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/osint-tools" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://securitytrails.com/blog/osint-tools</a></p><p><br></p><p>We also took a look at our own tool used for gathering information, and we got really good results with it! The more we go through the course the more we need to get into creating our own tools as that eventually becomes a part of being an ethical hacker. Here are some good news! At the and of the course we have added bonus sections that cover Python Programming Basics so all of you that never had any programming experience can go through those videos first and then get into the coding projects! But more about that later. Right now we are ready to cover one of the biggest tools Ethical Hackers use which is called Nmap, and we are going to do that in the next section that covers Scanning!</p>
