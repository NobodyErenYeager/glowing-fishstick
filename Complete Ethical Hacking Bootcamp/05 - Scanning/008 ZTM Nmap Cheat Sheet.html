<p>In order to help test your knowledge, but to also help you learn and remember common Nmap syntax and to use as a handy reference for what you've just learned, one of our ZTM Community Star Mentors has created a <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/nmap-cheat-sheet?utm_source=udemy&amp;utm_medium=coursecontent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>ZTM Nmap Cheat Sheet</strong></a> for you!</p><p>In this Nmap cheat sheet, you will find both Nmap command examples as well as explanations of when and why you would use certain options and arguments.</p><p>It also provides you with an overview of which commands require root/sudo privileges and compare the noise levels (measures the likelihood of alarming the target that you are scanning) of various commands.</p><p>There are a lot of Nmap commands that you can use that are very detailed and advanced. But the chances of ever needing to use them for the majority of users/students is quite low so we've kept this Nmap Cheat Sheet focused on the most important commands that you need to know and will use most often.</p>
