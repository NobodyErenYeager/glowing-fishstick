Routers are important devices in our network and anyone who manages to compromise our routers pretty much has access to our network and can control our network! </p><p>That is why we are going to talk about a tool called Routersploit that tests for known router exploits and checks for vulnerabilities and we are also going to talk about biggest problem and vulnerability that a lot of routers have!</p><p>And that is default passwords ..</p><p>More about all of this in next two videos!</p>
