<p><strong>Technically no!</strong></p><p><strong>However it is a huge huge plus</strong> .. As we already mentioned using only tools created by other people limits you. You can never create something new even if you have an idea. Programming allows us to put that idea to work and create the program we want. Maybe programming will help you in developing an attack that wasn't used before ? Maybe you cant find a tool that you want ? Or at least it will make you understand a lot better how other programs and attacks work ..</p><p>So even though it is not required to become an Ethical Hacker, it is a skill that you should definitely look forward to learn. </p><p>Since in the next video we are going to be creating our first hacking tool, just a quick reminder that you have a couple hours of python for beginners videos at the end of the course in case you have no previous programming experience! If you have, feel free to continue to the next video where we create our port scanner.</p><p>The most important library that we will use to create our program and many other programs from this course,&nbsp; is called <strong>socket</strong> library. Even though I&nbsp;explain what all of the functions that we use do, here is a link to socket library documentation in case you want to learn more about it and check out other possibilities with this library!</p><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html</a></p>
