<p>Alright! This project was a little bit hard I admit. But we got through it. However this doesnt have to be the end of it!</p><p>You can continue building on and adding new functions that you might find useful. There are no limitations!</p><p>Here are some of the things you might want to add to our backdoor:</p><ol><li><p>Keylogger - You might want to capture keystrokes on the target machine. Keylogger would be a perfect thing to code and add as a part of our backdoor to achieve this!</p></li><li><p>Elevate Privileges - Maybe you want to try to elevate privileges with this program. Perhaps you need it to access some restricted file ? There are many different ways that it can be done and if you think this is something you need. You can always add it as a new option to our code!</p></li><li><p>Record Microphone &amp; Desktop - You can add an option that will take a screenshot of targets desktop. Or even better you can maybe make your program record a microphone to perhaps hear if the person is talking to someone ? </p></li></ol><p>These are just some of the options. Feel free to add anything you think is needed! </p><p>Now we are ready to continue to another big topic that awaits us which is Website Application Penetration Testing!</p>
