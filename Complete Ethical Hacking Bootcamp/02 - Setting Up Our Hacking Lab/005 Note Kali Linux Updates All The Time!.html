<p><strong><em>Helloooo!</em></strong></p><p>We have just learned from where we can download the Kali Linux Operating System And Virtual Box. But when it comes to Kali Linux it gets around <strong>4-5 updates</strong> every year! We must make sure to keep up with everything that they add to each update(sometimes they can be huge updates but usually they are not). For more information about this and for more information about installing older versions of Kali Linux, check out the lecture called "<strong><em>New &amp;&nbsp;Old Versions Of Kali Linux</em></strong>" from this section!</p><p>If you wish to download any previous version of Kali Linux, you can do that by downloading the image from:</p><p><a href="http://old.kali.org/kali-images/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://old.kali.org/kali-images/</a></p><p><br></p><p>Another thing&nbsp;(<strong><em>Only If your device is an Apple M1</em></strong>), virtual box is still not supported on M1. However there are multiple alternatives for it. You can install Kali Linux on Virtualization Software called UTM (which is free to use). Parallels is another option to use to install kali on M1 device (but this one is a paid software). The choice is completely yours! If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out in the Q&amp;A. (On any other device whether it being Linux, Windows or Intel Mac, Virtual Box will work without issues)</p>
